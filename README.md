Experiments in getting a video game up and running in OpenGL.

- Fixed update time slicing.
- Bullet Physics integration with basic player controller and triangle mesh collision.
- Parent-Child scene hierarchy system supporting linear interpolation between fixed update time deltas.
- Deferred rendering pipeline capable of rendering shadow maps.
- Runtime-generated shader code & material/mesh identification during fragment shader.
- ~~Extremely fast voxel terrain mostly generated via geometry shader.~~ *scrapped*
- Excellent performance even on potatoes.
